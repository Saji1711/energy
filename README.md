# Energy Efficiency Optimization

## Project Overview

Energy Efficiency Optimization is an AI- and IoT-powered system designed to reduce unnecessary energy consumption in residential, commercial, and industrial environments. It leverages real-time data analytics, smart sensors, and predictive models to help users monitor, manage, and minimize their energy usage efficiently.

## Problem Statement

With the rise in global energy demands, inefficient energy consumption leads to increased utility costs and environmental degradation. This project addresses these challenges by building an intelligent system that:

- Monitors real-time energy usage.
- Identifies inefficient patterns.
- Suggests actionable energy-saving tips.
- Automates smart control of appliances.

## Objectives

- Develop a smart energy management system using IoT and AI.
- Provide real-time energy analytics and optimization recommendations.
- Improve user awareness through interactive dashboards and gamification.
- Secure user data through encryption and secure communication protocols.

## Key Features

- *AI Model*: Trained using Random Forest to predict inefficiencies and suggest optimizations.
- *IoT Integration*: Smart plugs and sensors for real-time monitoring and control.
- *Dashboard Interface*: CLI (with future plans for web dashboard) for displaying energy stats and tips.
- *Chatbot*: Provides quick feedback and personalized energy-saving suggestions.
- *Gamification*: Users earn rewards for improving their energy efficiency.
- *Security*: Data encryption using AES and token-based API authentication.
